## How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions

We welcome various types of contributions:

-   **Bug fixes**: Fix existing issues
-   **New features**: Add new functionality
-   **Documentation**: Improve or add documentation
-   **Tests**: Add or improve test coverage
-   **Performance**: Optimize existing code
-   **Refactoring**: Improve code quality without changing behavior

### Contribution Workflow

1. **Check existing issues** to avoid duplicate work
2. **Create an issue** for major changes to discuss first
3. **Write code** following our coding standards
4. **Add tests** for new functionality
5. **Update documentation** as needed
6. **Submit a pull request**

## Coding Standards

All code must follow the standards defined in `.github/instructions/cs.instructions.md`. Key points:

### Naming Conventions

-   **PascalCase**: Classes, methods, properties, public members
-   **camelCase**: Local variables, parameters
-   **\_camelCase**: Private fields (with underscore prefix)

### Code Style

-   Use file-scoped namespaces
-   Enable nullable reference types
-   Use modern C# features (C# 12)
-   Follow SOLID principles
-   One type per file

### Documentation

-   Add XML comments for all public APIs
-   Include `<summary>`, `<param>`, `<returns>`, `<exception>` tags
-   Provide usage examples for complex APIs

### Example

```csharp
namespace YourLibrary.Services;

/// <summary>
/// Provides customer management services.
/// </summary>
public class CustomerService
{
    private readonly ICustomerRepository _repository;

    /// <summary>
    /// Initializes a new instance of the <see cref="CustomerService"/> class.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="repository">The customer repository.</param>
    /// <exception cref="ArgumentNullException">
    /// Thrown when <paramref name="repository"/> is null.
    /// </exception>
    public CustomerService(ICustomerRepository repository)
    {
        ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull(repository);
        _repository = repository;
    }

    /// <summary>
    /// Gets a customer by their unique identifier.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="customerId">The customer identifier.</param>
    /// <returns>The customer if found; otherwise, null.</returns>
    public async Task<Customer?> GetCustomerAsync(int customerId)
    {
        ArgumentOutOfRangeException.ThrowIfNegativeOrZero(customerId);
        return await _repository.GetByIdAsync(customerId);
    }
}
```

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Organization

-   **Unit tests**: `tests/YourLibrary.Tests/UnitTests/`

    -   No external dependencies
    -   Fast and isolated
    -   Use mocking for dependencies

-   **Integration tests**: `tests/YourLibrary.Tests/IntegrationTests/`
    -   Test component interactions
    -   May use real dependencies
    -   Validate end-to-end scenarios

### Test Structure

Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern:

```csharp
[Fact]
public void MethodName_Scenario_ExpectedResult()
{
    // Arrange
    var sut = new SystemUnderTest();
    var input = "test";

    // Act
    var result = sut.Method(input);

    // Assert
    result.Should().Be("expected");
}
```

### Test Requirements

-   All new public methods must have tests
-   Aim for >80% code coverage for new code
-   Use descriptive test names
-   Use FluentAssertions for readable assertions
-   Tests should be fast and deterministic

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
dotnet test

# Run specific category
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~UnitTests"

# Run with coverage
dotnet test /p:CollectCoverage=true /p:CoverletOutputFormat=opencover
```

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Update your branch** with latest upstream changes:

    ```bash
    git fetch upstream
    git rebase upstream/main
    ```

2. **Ensure all tests pass**:

    ```bash
    dotnet test
    ```

3. **Check code compiles** without warnings:

    ```bash
    dotnet build
    ```

4. **Run code analysis** (if available)

5. **Update documentation** for any API changes

### PR Guidelines

-   **Title**: Use a clear, descriptive title

    -   `feat: Add customer search functionality`
    -   `fix: Resolve null reference in OrderService`
    -   `docs: Update API documentation for CustomerService`
    -   `test: Add unit tests for PaymentProcessor`

-   **Description**: Include:

    -   What changes were made
    -   Why the changes were necessary
    -   Any breaking changes
    -   Related issue numbers (e.g., "Fixes #123")

-   **Size**: Keep PRs focused and reasonably sized

    -   Prefer smaller, focused PRs over large ones
    -   If making large changes, break into multiple PRs

-   **Commits**:
    -   Use clear, descriptive commit messages
    -   Squash commits if requested by reviewers
